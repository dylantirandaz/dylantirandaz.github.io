    <section id="about">
        <p>
            I’m a Computer Science and Physics undergraduate student, with a passion for machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, quantitative research, and robotics. Currently, I’m focused on software engineering projects that explore these domains. I’ve worked on various projects, including wine quality prediction using machine learning and a real-time monitoring system for silicon solar cells, utilizing IoT sensors and AI optimization. Additionally, I have a growing interest in quantitative research and financial modeling, having explored areas such as Geometric Brownian Motion for option pricing. My long-term goal is to combine my expertise in AI and quantitative methods to solve impactful, real-world problems across multiple industries.
